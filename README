Data set for "Bacterial cheating drives the population dynamics of cooperative
antibiotic resistance plasmids" by Eugene A Yurtsev, Hui Xiao Chao, Manoshi S
Datta, Tatiana Artemova, Jeff Gore

The majority of the data is contained within the data subfolder inside csv
files. The naming of the files within this directory should be self-explanatory.
One data file is included within the Figure 1 subfolder. This data files contains
the 3 time traces that were used to produce Figure 1A.

ipynb files are ipython notebook files that contain some analysis and/or
produce figures from the csv files. These files are not necessary to reproduce
any of the figures and were provided only as convenience when was possible.
